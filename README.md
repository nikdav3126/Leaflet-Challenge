# Leaflet-Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create an interactive map object charted with the last 7 days of earthquake data pulled from the United States Geological Survey. This data pulled from the following [USGS GeoJSON Feed] (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) was then used to plot on the map the earthquakes that were recorded.
